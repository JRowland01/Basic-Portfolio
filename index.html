      <h2>About Me</h2>
    
      <img id="profile-pic" src="assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="Jimmia"/>

      <p>Jimmia Rowland has had an interest in web design/development since high school. Using Tripod and Geocities as "development playgrounds" and a trial version of Corel Paint, she taught herself HTML and helped her cousin build an anti-'N Sync website. The site attracted a good following and received tons of hate mail from 'N Sync fans. Good times.</p>

      <p>Jimmia has a BS in Computer Information Systems and has had various positions related to web content management, digital marketing and design. She enrolled in Full Stack Development Bootcamp to update her skill set. Eventually, she will get used to managing files primarily from the backend with Git and Heroku, and become less reliant on FTP clients and Windows' UI. Eventually.</p>
